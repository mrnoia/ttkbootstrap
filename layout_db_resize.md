# GUI with Tkinter and SQLite

This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library in Python. The GUI consists of a window with a grid of 3x3 frames, each with a label in the center displaying data from a SQLite database.

## How it works
1. The first line imports the Tkinter library, which is used to create the GUI. The second line imports the sqlite3 library, which is used to interact with the SQLite database.
2. The code creates a Tkinter window with a size of 200x200 pixels and assigns it to the variable "root".
3. The variable "colors" is defined as a list of strings containing the colors "red", "green", and "blue".
4. The code creates a connection to a SQLite database named "mydatabase.db" using the sqlite3 library.
5. The code then queries the data from the 'data' table in the database, and retrieves the data using the fetchall() method.
6. The code then creates a nested for loop that iterates through the rows and columns of the 3x3 grid, and creates a frame for each cell with its background color determined by the colors list. The data value is also displayed in the center of the frame using a label.
7. The code then calls the columnconfigure() and rowconfigure() methods on the root window to set the weight of each column and row in the grid to 1.
8. The code then defines a function named "on_resize" that adjusts the font size of all labels in the grid when the window is resized. 
9. Finally, the code binds the on_resize function to the "Configure" event of the root window, so that the function is called whenever the window is resized. The code also calls the mainloop() method on the root window to start the GUI and wait for events.
10. Finally, it closes the database connection.
